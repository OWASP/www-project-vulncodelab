# VulnCodeLab: The Future of Secure Code Review Training

---

Modern applications are built fast â€” and broken faster.  
**VulnCodeLab** is a purpose-built, full-stack, intentionally vulnerable enterprise-grade environment designed to **train developers, security engineers, and AppSec teams** in **manual secure code review**.

Unlike traditional exploitation-based labs (like OWASP Juice Shop), VulnCodeLab focuses on **white-box auditing**: finding code-level bugs, security misconfigurations, business logic flaws, and advanced vulnerabilities by reading and understanding the source code itself.
