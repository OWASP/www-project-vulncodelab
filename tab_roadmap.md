- Create GraphQL API service with vulnerable queries/mutations
- Develop initial AI/LLM vulnerable components (prompt injection, model exploits)
- Update vulnerabilities to match OWASP Top 10 Web/API 2025 versions

---

## Phase 3: Mobile + Next-Gen Modules (TBA)
- Build Mobile app (Flutter or React Native) with mobile-specific vulnerabilities
- Add advanced AI/LLM modules (agent manipulation, data exfiltration via LLMs)
- Optional: Web3 smart contract module (if viable)

---

## Parallel Track: Ecosystem Growth
